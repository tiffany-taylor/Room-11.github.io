	<h1>Guides and Tutorials for Learning PHP</h1>
	<p>Note: This guide assumes you already have an understanding of HTML/CSS.  It is highly recommended that you understand HTML/CSS before learning PHP.  <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">Freecodecamp</a> offers practical tutorials in learning HTML/CSS/JS.</p>

	<p>After getting the bssics under your belt, here are some other resources to help tie it together.</p>

		<li><a href="https://github.com/PatrickLouys/no-framework-tutorial" target="_blank">https://github.com/PatrickLouys/no-framework-tutorial</a> (Note: This is slightly outdated in some parts, but it is still a good, practical tutorial in learning how to write professional PHP)</li>
	</ul>
	<!-- Possible TODO: Add additional sections to other areas of learning besides security and database interaction
		 Information on other databases other than MySQL, e.g. PostgreSQL, SQLite... -->
	<h3><a id="security">Security</a></h3>
	<p>Keeping your application secure is important!  To quote <a href="https://www.owasp.org/images/7/72/OWASP_Top_10-2017_%28en%29.pdf.pdf" target="_blank">OWASP's Top 10 2017</a>: the harm [of a vulnerable application] that is caused may be of no consequence, or it may put you out of business.  Ignoring your application's security is not a valid defense in protecting yourself.</p>
	<ul>

		<li><a href="http://php.net/manual/en/faq.passwords.php" target="_blank">http://php.net/manual/en/faq.passwords.php</a> - explanation on password hashing</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3><a id="database">Database Interaction</a></h3>
	<p>There will likely become a time that you'll need to interact with a database.  <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php" target="_blank">PDO</a> is best suited to this task.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://wiki.hashphp.org/PDO_Tutorial_for_MySQL_Developers" target="_blank">http://wiki.hashphp.org/PDO_Tutorial_for_MySQL_Developers</a> - learning how to use PDO when coming from a MySQL/MySQLi background</li>

	</ul>
	
	<h2><a id="advanced">Advanced</a></h2>
	<p>Alright, you've made it this far, and the quirks of PHP haven't scared you away.  Here's additional material to further your learning.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://patricklouys.com/professional-php/" target="_blank">https://patricklouys.com/professional-php/</a> This is a book written by the same author for the No-Framework Tutorial, but is updated.</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/danack/example" target="_blank">https://github.com/danack/example</a> - Shows how to use Xdebug, Behat tests, Docker for local development, Supervisord for background workers and Slim framework with Auryn DI. This is beneficial to see how a full-fledged PHP application would look working inside Docker, with requisite documentation, and example code.</li>
		<li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/5864000/2524730" target="_blank">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5863870/how-should-a-model-be-structured-in-mvc</a> - an explanation of what models are in the MVC relationship</li>
		<li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/16356866/2524730" target="_blank">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16356420/mvc-for-advanced-php-developers</a> - a list of videos and reading material</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2><a id="development-environment">Development Environment</a></h2>
	<p>PHP isn't the only thing you should learn! A useful skill is knowing how to set up your own development environment without using XAMPP.  Below are guides on setting up different development environments. (Note that VM means Virtual Machine)</p>
	
	<h3><a id="vagrant">Vagrant</a></h3>		
	<p><a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/intro/getting-started/index.html" target="_blank">https://www.vagrantup.com/intro/getting-started/index.html</a> - Vagrant is a software that allows you to set up a development environment VM quickly.  You can find vagrantboxes that other people have created and uploaded, in which you can use instead of setting up a VM in Vagrant from scratch</p>
	
	<h3><a id="docker">Docker</a></h3>
	<p><a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-started/" target="_blank">https://docs.docker.com/get-started/</a> - another common development environment is Docker.  It is an alternative to VMs because it does not require the setting up and maintenance that regular VMs do.  It is able to do this through the use of <a href="https://www.docker.com/what-container" target="_blank">containers</a>.</p>
	
	<h3><a id="roll-your-own-vm"><a id="rolling-your-own-vm">Rolling Your Own VM</a></a></h3>
	<p>The options below are guides on setting up a development environment from scratch using a VM on your computer.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-apache-mysql-php-lamp-stack-on-ubuntu-16-04" target="_blank">Setting up a LAMP environment (Linux [Ubuntu], Apache, MySQL, PHP)</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-nginx-mysql-php-lemp-stack-in-ubuntu-16-04" target="_blank">Setting up a LEMP environment (Linux [Ubuntu], nginx, MySQL, PHP)</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-lemp-nginx-mysql-php-stack-on-arch-linux" target="_blank">Another setting up a LEMP environment (Linux [Arch], nginx, MySQL, PHP)</a></li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3><a id="linux">Linux</a></h3>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-linux-basics" target="_blank">https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-linux-basics</a> - Linux basics</li>
		<!-- TODO: Add some more Linux guides -->
	</ul>
	<p>In regards to troubleshooting in Linux, Google is your best friend.  Seriously.  If you have an error or problem, google the error or the nature of the problem, 90% of the time, someone else has encountered your situation as well, and you can find an answer pretty quickly. 10% of the time, it's a weird issue, and you'll either need to do more digging through google with some clever keywords, or ask someone.</p>
	
	<h2>Some other notes...</h2>
	<p>If you have an aversion to Oracle products, you can use <a href="https://mariadb.org/" target="_blank">mariaDB</a> instead of MySQL which is virtually the same as MySQL, except that it is not owned by Oracle.</p>
	<p>Lastly, <a href="http://www.giannistsakiris.com/2008/04/09/virtualbox-access-windows-host-shared-folders-from-ubuntu-guest/" target="_blank">this guide explains how to set up shared folders in Virtualbox from Windows</a>.  It took me a lot of digging to find it, and it was extremely helpful for me</a>.</p>
	
	<h2><a id="books">Book Recommendations</a></h2>
	<p>Most of these are not specific to PHP, but if you're serious and dedicated to learning how to develop, here are some books that will help you.  I've chosen not to provide links to these books, as your preferred method of purchasing books may be different than mine.  Googling each book will give you options on how to purchase them.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><em>Clean Code</em> by Robert Martin</li>
		<li><em>Refactoring</em> by Martin Fowler and Kent Beck</li>
		<li><em>Pragmatic Programmer</em> by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas</li>
		<li><em>Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture</em> by Martin Folwer, Dave Rice</li>
		<li><em>Working Effectively with Legacy Code</em> by Michael Feathers (if you're ever dumped onto a project that's using an unsupported version of PHP...)</li>
		<!-- not entirely sure if I should include this, as some of the things Josh Lockhart suggests in the book are disputed... -->
		<li><em>Modern PHP</em> by Josh Lockhart - created by the author of <a href="https://www.phptherightway.com/" target="_blank">https://www.phptherightway.com/</a></li>
